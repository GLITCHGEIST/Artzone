<b>FLIPP INC.</b> is a game made for the [2024 Biome Collective Exquisite Corpse Jam](https://biomecollective.itch.io/biome-exquisite-corpse-game-jam-2024). Each month a pair of developers would make a game and pass a prompt onto the next team. Prompts were small snippets of the game designed to inspire without giving anything away. At the end of the year we played all of the games back-to-back and finally learned what each of the other teams had made.

Our month was <b>JUNE 2024</b> and the prompt we were given consisted of an <b>untextured bowl of soup</b> and <b>elevator music</b>. With this we created a comedy-driven game about being forced to make advertising posters for strange products. Players use a limited number of backgrounds and stickers to create collages, and their creations are judged at the end of each "working day".

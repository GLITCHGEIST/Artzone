The <b>PETTING ZOO</b> is a webtoy built for my [neocities](https://ghosttyrant.neocities.org/pettingzoo) site, inspired by virtual pets and the original <b>Zoo Tycoon</b>.
<br>Visitors can pet the animals and drag and drop items for them to interact with. Each animal has its own item interactions, sleep schedule and relationship with the other animals. They even have their own birthdays, during which there is a special interaction!

The PETTING ZOO consists of a single javascript file that runs the simulation and a json file that contains all of the animal config, which allows for maximum customisation!

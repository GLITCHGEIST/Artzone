<b>SMITHY'S KITCHEN</b> is a VR game about cooking? smithing? a new sword for a gingerbread warrior. Made with a friend for [Global Game Jam 2020](https://globalgamejam.org/). 
<br>I wanted to make a haunted house, I wanted to hang out with my friends to celebrate the spooky season, I wanted to make neon pixels. I combined all of these thoughts and this is what appeared in my mind.

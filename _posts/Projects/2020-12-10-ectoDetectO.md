<b>ECTO-DETECT-O</b> is a remake/sequel(?) to a jam game I made years ago. It's about hanging out at a party and taking photos of ghosts.
<br>This was essentially a playground where I could experiment with Unity at my own pace and write dialogue for my OCs. It's currently On Hiatus but I love the mechanics so much that I may come back to it.

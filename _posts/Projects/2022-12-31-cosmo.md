<b>COSMO</b> is an ongoing project about <b>gay ghosts</b>.
<br>
<br>I sometimes post updates on my blog. Right now I am doing everything myself and in my own time, so it's taking a while.
<br>
<br>COSMO game has platforming, exploration, inventory, combat, cutscene and dialogue systems built largely from scratch.
<br>Built using [Otter2D](http://otter2d.com/) (but due to be ported to a newer engine soon) and [Moonsharp](https://www.moonsharp.org/)/Lua (for scripting).

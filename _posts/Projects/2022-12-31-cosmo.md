<b>COSMO</b> is a game about <b>gay ghosts</b>.
<br>
<br>I had a lot of big ideas for this project and dedicated much of my free time to developing a solid foundation. Ultimately, this incarnation of the project has been shelved, but the characters and world live on in a new project.
<br>
<br>COSMO has lighting, platforming, exploration, inventory, combat, cutscene and dialogue systems built largely from scratch.
<br>Built using [Otter2D](https://github.com/kylepulver/Otter) and [Moonsharp](https://www.moonsharp.org/)/Lua (for scripting).

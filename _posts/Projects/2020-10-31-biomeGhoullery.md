The <b>BIOME GHOULLERY</b> was a fun little Halloween Treat I made for my friends and I, located within the [Biome Gallery](https://biome-gallery.glitch.me). 
<br>I wanted to make a haunted house, I wanted to hang out with my friends to celebrate the spooky season, I wanted to make neon pixels. I combined all of these thoughts and this is what appeared in my mind.

The Biome Gallery is an online social space, built and hosted on the [glitch](https://glitch.com/) platform, and based on the [Online Museum of Multiplayer Art](https://likelike.glitch.me/?room=likelikeOutside).
